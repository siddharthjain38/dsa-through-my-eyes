# Linked List Notes

## Linked List Problems Overview

Linked list problems are usually **not too tough** from an algorithm perspective, but **coding** them can be tricky. The key challenge is managing pointer manipulation correctly to avoid errors.

## Key Edge Cases to Keep in Mind

### 1. When the Linked List is Null
- Always check if the list is empty (i.e., the head is `null`) before performing any operations. You can't perform actions on an empty list, so handle this case upfront.

### 2. When the Linked List Has Just One Node
- Make sure to properly handle cases where the list contains only one node. Operations like **deletion** or **reversal** should still work in this scenario, as the logic differs from lists with multiple nodes.

### 3. Problem-Specific Edge Cases
- Every linked list problem might come with its own set of edge cases—like:
  - Handling **cycles** (detecting loops in the list).
  - Dealing with **duplicates**.
  - Special edge cases related to **list length** or **positioning**.
  
  Always think through and test these specific edge cases based on the problem you're solving.

## Solution Approach

### 1. **If Linked List is Null or Empty**
- Always check if the linked list is **null** or **empty** (head is `null`) at the start. If it is, you can avoid unnecessary operations or handle it separately (e.g., return `null` or print an error message).

### 2. **If Linked List Has Only One Node**
- When the linked list contains only one node, the logic for operations like deletion, reversal, or insertion at the end might need special attention. For example:
  - **Reversing a single node**: The list should remain unchanged.
  - **Deleting the only node**: The list should become null after the node is deleted.

### 3. **Never Miss the Head Node**
- **Always copy the head node into a temporary variable** before making any changes.  
  This helps avoid losing the reference to the start of the list, especially when performing operations that modify the list, like deletion or reversal. If you lose the head reference, you could end up with an inaccessible list.

## Conclusion

When working with linked lists, it’s important to focus on edge cases like an empty list or a single-node list. **Never forget to copy the head node** to a temporary variable before manipulating the list. Also, make sure to consider problem-specific quirks (like cycles or duplicates) to avoid bugs.
